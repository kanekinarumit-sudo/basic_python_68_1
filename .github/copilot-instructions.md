# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
This repository is a basic Python teaching resource for IT68, maintained by Narumit. It is intended for educational purposes and contains simple Python scripts demonstrating fundamental concepts.

## Structure
- `python1.py`: Main script with annotated examples of Python comments, variables, type conversions, and naming conventions. All code is in a single file.
- `README.md`: Brief project description (in Thai and English).
- `note.txt`: (Purpose not documented; check contents if needed.)

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **Code is heavily commented** for instructional clarity. Preserve and extend inline documentation when adding new examples.
- **Variable naming**: Demonstrates multiple styles (`myvar`, `my_var`, `_my_var`, `myVar`). Follow the style used in the section you are extending.
- **Type conversion**: Explicit conversions are shown (e.g., `str(5)`, `int("5")`, `float("5.0")`). Use explicit casting for clarity.
- **Thai language**: Some comments and variable explanations are in Thai. Maintain bilingual comments if adding new instructional content.

## Developer Workflows
- **Run scripts**: Use `python python1.py` to execute the main script. No build or test automation is present.
- **No external dependencies**: The project uses only the Python standard library.
- **No test framework**: If adding tests, place them in separate files and document the workflow here.

## Extending the Project
- Add new Python concepts as additional sections in `python1.py`, using the same comment structure.
- If splitting into multiple files, update this document and the `README.md` to reflect the new structure.
- Keep all instructional code simple and beginner-friendly.

## Example Section Pattern
```
"""
# Part: [Section Title]
#
"""
# ...code and comments...
```
